"""
Search of an attribute/method in multiple inheritance:

(a) Python first tries to find the attribute in the instance object.

(b) If Python fails, it searches the class that it was constructed from.

(c) If Python fails, it searches (LEFT before RIGHT) upward from the class the
    object was constructed from (which appears at the bottom of the network),
    towards the root/object class.

(d) If Python reaches any base class and has not already searched all of its
    derived classes, that base class is not searched now; instead the derived
    class searches its REMAINING (to the RIGHT) base classes; and if it has
    searched all its base classes, its derived class searches its remaining (to
    the right) base classes, etc. 
    So, a base class can be searched ONLY if ALL its derived classes have already been searched.
"""

# How does Python know about the parent class(es) of a class.
# Every class object has a __bases__ attribute that is a tuple of its base
# classes; the order that it uses for the base classes in the tuple is the same

''' 
But How Python Actually Searches for Attributes:
The order of classes that Python uses to search for an attribute name is
actually computed when a class is defined (so the order doesn't need to be
recomputed for each attribute access); it is stored in the class attribute
__mro__

MRO: Method Resolution Order
but it is not only related to methods but also for attributes.

'''

print("D's mro", D.__mro__)

print("B's mro", B.mro())

"""
If there is no order that satisfies all these requirements (see below for an
example) then the algorithm will detect this fact and Python will raise a
TypeError exception when the class itself is defined: the __mro__ attribute for
the class is computed when the class is defined. The result of raising the
TypeError is that the class will not be defined and cannot be used.

print(D in type(a).__mro__) # since D is included in the __mro__ of A

# so, it would still catch it, why ??? because ZeroDivisionError

# If we wrote:

# 1. except BrokenPipeError: handles only the BrokenPipeError, since it is not the parent class of any child class
# 2. except ConnectionError: handles both ConnectionError and BrokenPipeError
# 3. except OSError: handles OSError, ConnectionError, FileNotFoundError, and BrokenPipeError
# 4. except Exception: handles Exception, OSError, ConnectionError, FileNotFoundError, and BrokenPipeError
# ... so on
#
# # note you can also write the Exception classes in a tuple:
# # except (ConnectionError, BrokenPipeError)
# # can be any number of classes in the tuple
#
# # So be careful when trying to catch exceptions that have a base class that is also one of your except lines.

# #
# c = HideInfoChild()

# ######## MIXINS ###########
# # 1. What are Mixins? Mixins are small classes (that you create) that have methods and attrubutes  in order to provide an additional functionality to another class. So mixins customize and enhance another class. To use the mixin as somethings that provides additional fetures to your code, make your code(which is your class) inherit from this MIXIN you just created.
#
# # 2. When would you want to use a mixin? In 2 cases:
#     # - In order to provide a lot of optional features for a class.
#     # - In order to use one particular feature in a lot of different classes.
#
# # 3. You usually do not create new instance objects from mixins.
#

# #######
# # IGNORE FOR NOW: The main differences between Mixins and Decorators are:
#
# # Decorators wrap functionality around a piece of code.
#
# # Mixins add functionality to code using Inheritance.
#
# # There are some restrictions on each method.
#
# # Mixins only work with Object-Oriented Programming and Classes.
#
# # You cannot use Mixins to modify a function or a method, only classes.
#
# # Decorators cannot add new methods or new pieces of code.
#
# # A decorator just accepts a piece of code, modifies it and returns it. It cannot add something new. If you decorate Function A, you cannot simultaneously add Function B.

# Duck Typing == Polymorphism

# Duck typing is a polymorphism notion. The term duck typing is derived from a proverb that says
# everything that walks like a duck quacks like a duck, and swims like a duck is referred to like a duck
# regardless of the item. In basic terms, it indicates that if anything matches its behavior to another, it
# will be considered a member of the category to which it belongs.


# Abstract classes work as interfaces, meaning they give a hint on how the derived classes should look like

# Any classes that have at least one abstarct method is considered an abstract class

# If a class is abstract then you cannot instantiate objects from it
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# import abc

    flag = True
    @abstractmethod
    def get_capital(self):
        pass

    def get_capital(self):
        return 'Washington'
    def get_language(self):

# c = Country()

# Inheritance


# 1. A derived/child/subclass should be just like its base class: all the base class methods should make sense for the child.
# The relationship between the child and parent class is an "IS - A" relationship.


# 2. Inheritance looks for attributes by this rule: after checking for an attribute in the namespace (__dict__)
# of an object, it is sequentially checks for it in the namespaces of each class in the __mro__ attribute.
# o = myClass()

# 3. To call a method in the parent class from the same method (that overrides it) in the child class,
# use ParentClass.method()
# class Parent():
# def __str__(self):
#   pass

# class Child():
# def __str__(self):
#     Parent.__str__()  or super().__str__()

# 4. Typically the __init__ in the child class calls the __init__ method of its parent class, passing along some arguments

# 5. A child class should not directly access the data attributes in any of its parent classes,
# instead the base class should provide methods to access/mutate it.
